# Restaurant-Page
This project dynamically renders the home page for a restaurant's website

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)

> This project is a demonstration of DOM manipulation using JavaScript and attempts to 
dynamically generate the entire contents of the website using JavaScript alone. In order
to keep the code clean and maintainable, I'm using ES6 classes (where they are suitable)
and webpack for modular code.
